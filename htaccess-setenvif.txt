RewriteRule ^ - [R=410]

#
# This tests using an environment variable to issue a Redirect, but there are 
# three problems:
#
# 1) An upgrade to Apache (2.4.25) since I started this code changed Apache's 
#    behavior so that a URL: "/tmp" results in a 301. Using "/tmp/" results in 
#    the 410.
#
# 2) The <If...> does not work (trying to block directory exploits) if the 
#    directory *does not exist*; in that case a 404 is always sent (which is 
#    why 410 is used here). And that 404 has precdence over all directives.
#
# 3) If the URI has a file name, like /foo.txt, none of them work.
#
# But the RewriteRule always works.
