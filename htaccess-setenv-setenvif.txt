# From Apache:
# The internal environment variables set by this directive are set after most 
# early request processing directives are run, such as access control and 
# URI-to-filename mapping. If the environment variable you're setting is meant 
# as input into this early phase of processing such as the RewriteRule 
# directive, you should instead set the environment variable with SetEnvIf.
