#
# The simple but no NoCase way to block Bot path requests.
#
# FilesMatch has precedence except for "/foo/" -- since foo exists,a 404 is 
# always sent; but not for "/foo" though. With files, "foo/foo.txt" the 
# redirects always happen.
#
# The directories are still both looked for, which means Redirect 404 here 
# would be superfluous, *except* see htaccess-filetype.txt that would 
# normally redirect not founds to index.php.
#
# See also htaccess-setenvif.txt, htaccess-filetype.txt.
