# This was to see if FilesMatch/RedirectMatch will "head off access" early, 
# i.e. send a 404 without even checking for the file. This was the hope for 
# Bots requesting known exploitable .js files by the dozen every day.
#
# This does not do that -- Apache always checks for the file.
#
# But if you want to send a 403 or 410, these will do that.
