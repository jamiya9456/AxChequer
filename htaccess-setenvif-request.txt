# Trying to head off Bot requests. It does a funny thing. The first Redirect 
# 403 for /foo/, which exists, works. But that Redirect 403 for /bar/, which 
# does not exist, does not work, a normal 404 is sent.
#
# But the RedirectMatch 403 works for both.
#
# And as with FileMatch, the directories are still both looked for, which 
# means Redirect 404 here has no benefit and is superfluous.
