# Trying to head off Bot request paths. It does a funny thing. The first 
# Redirect only works for existing paths, otherwise a normal 404 is sent.
# And, a request of /foo/foo.txt is not denied by it. So, it's useless for 
# this. (It's the problem with "reqenv()".)
#
# But the RedirectMatch works for both as does the <If>.
#
# And as with FileMatch, the directories are still both looked for, which 
# means Redirect 404 here would be superfluous.
